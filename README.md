AI-Powered Customer Support Automation System using LangGraph, RAG, SQLite Memory, and Human-in-the-Loop.
# 🤖 AI-Powered Customer Support Automation System

An intelligent Customer Support Automation System built using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **Groq LLM**, **FAISS**, and **SQLite Memory**. The system classifies customer queries, retrieves relevant company information using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), maintains conversation history, routes requests to specialized support agents, and supports Human-in-the-Loop approval for high-risk operations.

* Classifying customer queries
* Routing requests to specialized support agents
* Retrieving information from company documents using RAG
* Maintaining customer conversation history with SQLite
* Requesting human approval for critical requests
* Reviewing responses using a Supervisor Agent

# 📚 Knowledge Base

The system retrieves information from:

* Company Policy
* Pricing Guide
* Technical Manual
* FAQ Document

using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

# 🧠 Memory

SQLite is used to store customer conversations.

Example:

Customer:

> My name is David. I have a billing issue.

Later:

> What was my previous support issue?

The system retrieves the previous conversation from SQLite memory.

# 👨‍💼 Human-in-the-Loop

The following requests require human approval:

* Refund Requests
* Subscription Cancellation
* Account Closure
* Compensation Requests
* Escalation to Management
